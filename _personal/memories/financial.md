## Spending Pattern Analysis (January 2026)

### Food Spending Pattern (Updated 21 Jan)
- **Total Food**: Rp 2,881,289 (143 transactions in 21 days)
- **Daily Average**: Rp 137,204/day (improved from Rp 154K)
- **Avg Transactions/Day**: 6.8 food purchases (improved from 7.6)

### Spending Habits
- Very high frequency of small food/drink purchases (6-7 per day)
- Heavy spending on Thursday/Friday (big bills due)
- Regular installment payments across multiple platforms
- Large one-time education expenses distort monthly view
- New: Healthcare costs (vaksin anak) adding unexpected expenses

### Income Sources (Reliable)
- Monthly salary: Rp 7,000,000
- Petfirst freelance: Rp 1,500,000
- Client projects (variable): e.g., Pak Habiddin Rp 3.5M

### Red Flags
1. Monthly debt obligations (~Rp 5.2M) exceed 60% of regular income (Rp 8.5M)
2. Took new loan (Rp 1.98M GoPay) in Jan 15 - debt spiral continues
3. Cash balance (Rp 2.3M) critically low relative to obligations
4. Food spending (Rp 154K/day) is ~55% of daily income allocation
5. Multiple loans across platforms create complexity and risk
6. Net cashflow -Rp 14.4M but ~Rp 10M was education (one-time)

## S2 ITS Financial Projection (Starting Feb 2026)

### Tuition Cost
- **Total**: Rp 80,000,000 (4 semesters @ Rp 20M)
- **Company Support**: Requested 50% minimum (pending approval)
- **Personal Cost (50% scenario)**: Rp 40,000,000
- **Per Semester**: Rp 10,000,000
- **Per Month**: ~Rp 1,666,667 (if paid monthly)
- **Bond**: 2n+1 = 5 years with DSG after graduation

### Financial Impact Scenarios

**Best Case (100% company support):**
- No direct cost
- Only opportunity cost (time for study)

**Target Case (50% company support):**
- Rp 10M per semester out of pocket
- Need to find Rp 1.67M/month additional
- Total personal investment: Rp 40M over 2 years

**Worst Case (< 50% or no support):**
- Full Rp 20M per semester
- Need Rp 3.33M/month additional
- Financially not feasible with current debt load

### Risk Assessment
- Bond 5 years locks you to DSG (good if salary increases, bad if better opportunities arise)
- Adding Rp 1.67-3.33M monthly obligation on top of Rp 5.2M debt = high risk
- Current cash flow already negative Rp 14.4M/month

## Important Notes
- Single account setup (all transactions in one "Kas" account)
- Using WhatsApp integration for transaction recording
- Currency: IDR (Indonesian Rupiah)
- Pegadaian loan (Rp 9M) planned to be extended, not paid off in March 2026
- [2026-01-18] Registered for S2 ITS MMT, start Feb 2026 if accepted
